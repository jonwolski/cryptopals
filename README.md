# Cryptopals

These are my exercises for [cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com).

From the site:

> We can't introduce these any better than [Maciej Ceglowski](https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/) did, so read that blog post first.
>
> We've built a collection of 48 exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto.
>
> This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked.

Challenges 1 & 2 can be run with `cargo test`

Challenge 3 can be run with `cargo run --bin challenge3`
